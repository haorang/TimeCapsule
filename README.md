# TimeCapsule
### A Reminder and Webpage Saver Chrome Extension

TimeCapsule is a chrome extension that allows users to save pages they would like to see at a later date. TimeCapsule will then display these pages at a later date decided by the user. For example, one reads a speculative financial report that they are curious about and want to see how things actually fold out. The user can set a reminder that will open the tab with a message two months later. TimeCapsule can also be used as a short term reminder system, such as by saving a job application web page to be opened a couple days before the due date.
